name: Modules.CoreMotion.StepCounter
platforms: [iphone, ipad]
summary: Allows Titanium client applications to access CoreMotion's (deprecated) StepCounter APIs.
since: "5.2.0"
extends: Titanium.Proxy
createable: true
deprecated:
    since: "5.2.0"
    notes: |
        This API was deprecated by Apple in iOS 7 and is only available for backward compatibility 
        with older versions of this module. It will be removed in the next release. Please use 
        <Modules.CoreMotion.Pedometer> API instead, which provides the same functionality including 
        new properties like `floorCount` and `distance`.

methods:

  - name: isStepCountingAvailable
    summary: Returns a Boolean indicating whether step-counting support is available on the current device.
    returns:
        type: Boolean

  - name: startStepCountingUpdates
    summary: Starts the delivery of current step-counting data to your app.
    description: |
        This method initiates tracking of the user's steps and calls the callback 
        periodically to deliver the results. When you call this method, the step counter 
        resets the current step count value to 0 and begins counting. Each time the step 
        counter records the number of steps in the stepCounts parameter, it executes the 
        specified callback. For example, if stepCounts is 100, it would send updates 
        at 100 steps, 200 steps, 300 steps, and so on. The number of steps reported to your 
        handler is always the total number of steps since you called this method.

        The callback is executed on a best effort basis each time the step count 
        threshold is exceeded. If your app is suspended when the threshold is exceeded, 
        the callback is not executed. When your app resumes, the callback is not executed 
        until the threshold is exceeded again.

        To stop the delivery of step-counting updates, call the 
        <Modules.CoreMotion.StepCounter.stopStepCountingUpdates> method. 

    parameters:
        - name: args
          summary: An object of arguments
          type: CoreMotionStartStepCountingArgs

        - name: callback
          summary: The callback to execute with the results.
          type: Callback<CoreMotionStepCountingDataWithSuccess>

  - name: stopStepCountingUpdates
    summary: Stops the delivery of step-counting updates to your app.
    description: |
        Call this method to stop the delivery of updates that you started by calling 
        the <Modules.CoreMotion.startStepCountingUpdates> method. This method does not 
        stop queries started using the <Modules.CoreMotion.StepCounter.queryStepCount> method.

  - name: queryStepCount
    summary: Gathers and returns historical step count data for the specified time period.
    description: |
        The system stores only the last seven days worth of step data at most. 
        If there are no samples for the specified range of time, a value of 0 is passed to the callback.
    parameters:
      - name: args
        summary: An object of arguments
        type: CoreMotionQueryStepCountArgs

      - name: callback
        summary: The callback to execute with the results.
        type: Callback<CoreMotionStepCountingQueryDataWithSuccess>
