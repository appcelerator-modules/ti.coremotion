name: Modules.CoreMotion.MotionActivity
platforms: [iphone, ipad]
summary: Allows Titanium client applications to access CoreMotion's MotionActivity APIs.
since: "5.2.0"
extends: Titanium.Proxy
createable: true

methods:
  - name: isActivityAvailable
    summary: Returns a Boolean indicating whether motion activity data is available on the current device.
    returns:
        type: Boolean

  - name: startActivityUpdates
    summary: Starts the delivery of current motion activity updates to your app.
    description: |
        This method initiates the tracking of motion data asynchronously. 
        Upon calling this method, the motion activity manager executes the 
        callback, reporting the current motion in effect for the device. 
        After that, the motion activity manager executes the callback only 
        when the motion data changes.

        The callback is executed on a best effort basis and updates are not 
        delivered while your app is suspended. If updates arrived while your 
        app was suspended, the last update is delivered to your app when it 
        resumes execution. To get all of the updates that occurred while your 
        app was suspended, use the <Modules.CoreMotion.MotionActivity.queryActivity> method.

        Upon starting activity updates, the motion activity manager reports 
        changes to its callback until you call the <Modules.CoreMotion.MotionActivity.stopActivityUpdates> 
        method. If you call this method again with a new callback, the activity 
        manager stops delivering updates to the old callback and delivers them 
        to the new callback instead.
        
    parameters:
      - name: callback
        summary: The method to be called when there is an update.
        type: Callback<CoreMotionActivityData>

  - name: stopActivityUpdates
    summary: Stops the delivery of motion activity updates to your app.

  - name: queryActivity
    summary: Gathers and returns historical motion activity data for the specified time period.

        This method runs asynchronously, returning immediately and delivering the results 
        to the specified callback. The system stores only the last seven days worth of 
        activity data at most. If there are no samples for the specified range of time, 
        an error object with the code <Modules.CoreMotion.ERROR_UNKNOWN> is passed to the 
        callback.
        
    parameters:
      - name: args
        summary: An object of arguments
        type: CoreMotionQueryActivityArgs

      - name: callback
        summary: The callback to execute with the results.
        type: Callback<CoreMotionActivityQueryDataWithSuccess>
